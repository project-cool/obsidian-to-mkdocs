  Database Id: 346be84507ff482b80fceb4024deadc2
  ```
- Populate these environment variables in ```.env``` file
  ```
  NOTION_API_KEY=your-notion-api-key
  BOOK_DB_ID=your-book-database-id
  ```
- Connect your **Kindle** to your computer. Navigate to ```Kindle``` ‚û° ```documents``` and copy ```My Clippings.txt```. Replace my ```My Clippings.txt``` in ```resources``` folder with yours.

# üîÅ Sync Highlights
Run the following command to watch your highlights teleport!
```
npm start
```
# ‚ùóÔ∏èFor Nerds
- Every highlight made on Kindle is appended at the end of ```My Clippings.txt```
- ```Book Name``` is used as the primary key to facilitate upsert operation in **Notion** database. So, this field should be left untouched. However, the other fields like **Title**, **Author**, **Date Started**, **Date Finished**, **Satus** and **Genre** could be modified as per your wish.
- This tool only syncs the new highlights made to each book. If no new highlights have been made, no sync takes place. 
- The info about the last sync is stored in ```sync.json``` present in ```cache``` folder.
- In case you wish to sync every book all over again, you need to empty the array present in ```sync.json``` and delete all the highlights present in your **Notion** database before running the sync. 
- Responses from Notion API calls are exported to files with ```.json``` extension in ```data``` folder. This was done to mitigate the problem of effectively logging JSON objects in the console (terminal).
